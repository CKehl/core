SYNOPSIS:
	The following example is from a paper in SODA'98 by
	Burnikel, Fleischer, Mehlhorn and Schirra (BFMS)
	describing their constructive root bound for radical expressions.

	Let POWER(k) = 2^POWER(k-1) if k > 0	, = 1 otherwise
	    SQRT(x, k) = sqrt(SQRT((x, k-1)) if k > 0  , = x otherwise

	This program computes SQRT(POWER(K+1) - 1, k) - 2,
	which should be very close to zero.

	We also use this as a demo of the use of Incremental Flag, to
	show the dramatic improvement in speed for some expressions.

NOTE: the Incremental Flag feature is temporarily unavailable
	in Core2 (Nov 2009).
