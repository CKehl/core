Core2 Library

The file "code-original.cpp" is from website of Shimshoni at Haifa.
It is based on a paper

"Fast triangle to triangle intersection test for collision detection",
	by O.Tropp, A.Tal and I.Shimshoni,
	Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds 17(5) 2006, pp 527-535.

It implements the current fastest code for tri-tri intersection
in 3-space.

We want to adapt this for Core Library for our applications:

(1) to check if a surface triangulation
or volume tetrahedralization is consistent

(2) to fine-tune Core to do these checks efficiently.
