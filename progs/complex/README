README file for progs/complex

	A complex number package developed primarily for use
	in the CEVAL algorithm (progs/mesh/ceval) . It contains
	(reasonably) complete implementations of polar and
	cartesian complex number classes. All basic arithmetic
	operations on complex numbers are defined, as well as
	conversions between the two types.
