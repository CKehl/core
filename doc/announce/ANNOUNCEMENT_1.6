===================== SOFTWARE RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT ==========================

June 20, 2003:
Core Library Version 1.6 is now available for free download at
	
		http://cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/

The Core Library (CORE) is a collection of C/C++ classes to support 
computation with real algebraic numbers (+,-,x,/,sqrt and rootOf), under a variety
of precision requirements.

Numerical nonrobustness is a widely acknowledged problem.  It has proven
particularly intractable in the context of geometric algorithms where
numerical data and combinatorial data are intermixed in a strongly constrained
manner.  Recent research in computational geometry has
demonstrated a variety of techniques based on the principles of
Exact Geometric Computation (EGC) that can address such problems.
A basic goal of our library is to make such techniques easily accessible to 
the wider community of programmers and researchers.

Basic CORE Features:
   -- ease of use:
	Any C/C++ programmer can write numerical or geometric
	code that are fully robust just by calling our Library.
   -- ease of migration:
	Many existing C/C++ programs can be converted into robust CORE
	programs with minimal effort.
   -- natural and novel numerical accuracy model:
	Users can choose and get the numerical accuracy that best fit
	their applications. 
   -- state of art technology:
	The precision-driven approach to EGC, best known root bounds,
	filter technology, etc, will be incorporated into the library
	as the field progresses.  In this way, the user's application program
	will automatically be upgraded (at the cost of re-compilation).
   -- small system:
	It can serve as the "robust core" of your own applications.
	About 550KB (including source, extensions, demos)
	when gmp and documentation is not included.  Otherwise, the full
	distribution is 3.6MB.
   -- extensively tested on Sun Sparc, Linux, cygwin and Windows platforms.

What is new with CORE 1.6 ?
   -- Arbitrary real algebraic numbers is now supported
   -- Faster code (can be significantly faster than CORE 1.5)
   -- Fully compatible with CGAL Library (Core Library is also
   	directly distributed with the CGAL Library)
   -- Improved root bounds (can be significant)
   -- Header files (i.e., API) for Expr and Real are now consistent
	This was necessary to support Level 2 accuracy.
	In general, slightly better support for Levels 2 and 4.
   -- Polynomial package directly incorporated into the Library
   -- Compatibility with gmp 4.1, and gcc 3.3
   -- Updated Core Library Tutorial
   -- Various new features:
        --Expr can return a double interval containing its true value 
	--
   -- Various Bug fixes: output

We welcome your comments and input.
