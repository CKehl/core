============== SOFTWARE RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT ===================


		Core Library Version 1.2.1
			Jan 12, 2000
		************************

This is a minor modification of version 1.2.

1) Each expression node is now given its
	own progressive flag (a Boolean value).
	If the flag is true, it will use progressive
	evaluation at that node.

	Otherwise, it goes directly to the root bound.
	Usage: if you have a good reason to think that
	a particular expression is identically zero, then
	you can set this flag to false.  The default
	is true.  In general, it is dangerous
	to set this flag to true.

	The default value of each node is that of the global
	progressive evaluation flag (which the user can set
	at any time).

2) The user can now create a debugging version of the
	Core Library and its programs.  In the top
	level, the file Make.config has a line to
	set VER=Debug.  The non-debug version would
	assign the empty string to VER.  

	The debugging version essentially compiles
	the programs with the -g compiler option, etc.

3) Bug fixed in square-root routine.  In BigFloat.cc,
	the algorithm for Newton iteration for
	square-roots may crash and give a zero-divisor
	error.  This is because when the mantissa is
	right shifted in the iteration, the function
	fails to check if the msb is shifted out.
